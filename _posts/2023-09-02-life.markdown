## Background
The Life Sciences division required a revamp of the outdated Cancer Assay tool interface, necessitating a transition to a more contemporary programming language. Tasked with this project, I initiated a thorough process of user research, which subsequently informed iterative design enhancements.

## Approach
In collaboration with the business leads, I conducted comprehensive user research to identify various pain points associated with the existing application. While retaining crucial elements, I overhauled the interface to unveil data in a sequential manner, aligning with users' preferred methods.

## Results
The revamped tool was developed by an offshore team under my guidance. The project garnered recognition when presented at an internal conference, securing an innovation award.

## Next Steps
Ideally, I would have preferred to continue monitoring metrics on this interface and further refine its usability. Unfortunately, due to the conclusion of the contract, I was unable to pursue these improvements.
