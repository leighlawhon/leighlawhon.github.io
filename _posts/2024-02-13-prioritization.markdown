## Background
Working at a SaaS startup can introduce unique prioritization challenges. You typically work with a small dev team, have many features to execute, on and have many stakeholders competing for their work. There are several ways to approach prioritization, but inevitably you will run into a situation where stakeholders and their work will have equal priority and you will have to make a call. 

In this article, I present my approach to prioritization and what to do when there is a stalemate. To illustrate this, I will use the following **FIFO** (first in first out) prioritized list of features for a fake SaaS Startup:

{% include feature_table.markdown%}

## Approach
Let's start with two basic prioritization techniques, MoSCoW and BRICE, to get an idea of how to prioritize when there is a clear hierarchy.

### Basic Prioritization Methods
The following frameworks help Product Managers put metrics around feature requests and cumminicate prioritization. Not only do these frame works allow PdMs to create a roadmap (when things will get done), they can help your stakehodlers understand why their work is prioritized the way it is. 

#### MoSCoW
MoSCoW, or Must, Should, Could, Wont (right now) is an easy to uderstand framework that can quickly sequence your feature requests. In my exeprience, I bucket requests in the following ways (note this can change depending on the company goals):
- **Must Do:** 
  - Something is broken and preventing usage of the app
  - There is a deadline that is enforced by a contract or compliance
  - The request is preventing another team from completing their work
- **Should Do:**
  - Something is broken, but there is a good workaround
  - The request will have a large impact (see BRICE)
- **Could Do:**
  - The exeprience can be improved, but is currently working
  - The request will have a small impact (see BRICE)
- **Wont Do (right now):**
  - No evidence of improvement to the experience and needs to be tested
  - The request will have a no noticable impact (see BRICE)

Below is how our feature list is prioritized with **MoSCoW**:

### Competing Stakeholders and Features
When prioritizing there will be conflict, where two or more stakeholders or features compete for the same spot. So what do you do then? In my experience, I first lean of leadership for guidance. However, when you are in a start up environmentn, company goals may be unclear, for example all stakeholders are fighting for your time to execute on their solutions to complete comapny OKRs. When this happens, I use the follwoing approaches and ask for buy in from the stake holders.

- **Linear:** Have the competing stakeholders rank and then complete features end-to-end and then move on to the next.
    - Benefit: Keeps the development team focused.
    - Drawback: Some teams have to wait a long time to get their work done, and teams that are not client facing, like the developer team, keep getting pushed back.
- **Ratios:** Split your teams into smaller pods, working on multiple team features. You can do a 50/50 split or a 30/70 split depending whether you want to put more emphasis on one feature.
    - Benefit: Engages more stakeholders
    - Drawback: The work get's done slower
- **Pivots:** Split the year and work on OKR's sequetially, pivoting to the next after MVP is complete.
    - Benefit: This can work well with early startups, 
    - Drawback: Sacrificing quarterly progress on one OKR. You must make sure you can address multiple OKRs in a year.
