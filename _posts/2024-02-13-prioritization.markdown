## Background
If you are a product manager working with a small team (ex. 1 product manager, 1 designer,and 8 developers), prioritization is crucial, especially if you are working with company stakeholders with competing priorities. Ideally, you are guided by well structured company OKRs, but often in a SaaS company, multiple teams have a dependency on the developer and product teams to achieve their OKRs.

In this example, for a fake startup, the comapny OKRs might look like this:

- **Objective 1**: Grow user base
    - **Key result:** Close 50 contracts by the end of Q1
    - **Key result:** Hit an average deal size of $100k
    - **Key result:** Obtain 100 new inbound leads by the end of Q1.

- **Objective 2**: Improve user retention
    - **Key result:** Reduce time to service each user by 10%
    - **Key result:** Improve engagement with products by 20%

## Approach
There are several ways you can manage competing OKRs and organizational teams. You can prioritize in the following ways:

- **Linear:** Have the competing stakeholders rank and then complete features end-to-end and then move on to the next.
    - Benefit: Keeps the development team focused.
    - Drawback: Some teams have to wait a long time to get their work done, and teams that are not client facing, like the developer team, keep getting pushed back.
- **Ratios:** Split your teams into smaller pods, working on multiple team features. You can do a 50/50 split or a 30/70 split depending whether you want to put more emphasis on one feature.
    - Benefit: Engages more stakeholders
    - Drawback: The work get's done slower
- **Pivots:** Split the year and work on OKR's sequetially, pivoting to the next after MVP is complete.
    - Benefit: This can work well with early startups, 
    - Drawback: Sacrificing quarterly progress on one OKR. You must make sure you can address multiple OKRs in a year.
