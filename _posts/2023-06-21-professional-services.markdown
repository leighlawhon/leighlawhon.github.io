There are a few things I wish I had done earlier in my career. The following proffessional servicces, now that I have them, have excelerated my career and my viability in the job market:
* Get a mentor and start mentoring
* Get my resume professionally written
* Create a protfolio
* Get a career coach


# Get a mentor and start mentoring
These two things, getting a mentor and start mentoring are not mutally exclusive.

# Get my resume professionally written
For most of my career I thought I was fully capable of writing my own resume. Nothing can be further from the truth, especially if you have a complicated story to tell such as changing careers or emplyment gaps. 

I used [TopResume.com](http://www.topresume.com) but there are many services out there. Mary at TopResume was able to take my broad, somewhat scattered exeprience, and turn it into a well structure story.

So one thing she did was lump together all my authoring and teaching experience.

Follwoing suite, I realized I could lump all of my disparate side projects and freelance work together by creating my own company. This also solves the problem of employmeny gaps. Employers seem to appreciate business experience and it allowed me to write some articles about the experience.

# Create a portfolio
TBH, I have had a version of a protfolio for most of my career, simply because I was a designer for so long. As I became a developer I started adding video clips of my work. However, if you are a developer, there is no reason you shouldn't also have a portfolio. 

If you are wondering how to get started, check out my course on LinkedIn Learning. In addition to teaching you how to build a portfolio, I'll teach you how to highlight your best work.

# Get a career coach
I just recently got a career coach. Why I didn't do this before now is beyond me. I am using [Virtual Freedom Coaching](http://www.vfcoaching.net/) by Dr. Priya Bains. I highly recommend VF Coaching for individuals who are innovator entreprenuers, such as myself. She does great work with creatives. She has helped me see patterns in my worklife and suggested changes to make me more efficient. 

Here are three reasons why you should look for a career coach.
