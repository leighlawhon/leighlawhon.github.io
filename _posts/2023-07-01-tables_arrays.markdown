## Background
This project aimed to teach the concepts of testing the speed of sorting algorithms. Over a span of two months, I meticulously developed the course, and the recording took place at the LinkedIn campus in Carpenteria, CA. 

## Approach
In all my courses, I strive to create a narrative that complements the learning objectives. In the case of this particular project, I found that using  as an analogy was a natural fit. By leveraging this analogy, I was able to elucidate complex JavaScript concepts in a simplified and easily understandable format for learners.

## Results
Upon publication, the course garnered significant attention, accumulating over 6,500 viewers to date. It remains one of my personal favorite tutorials, as it encapsulates my passion for teaching and the JavaScript language.

## Next Steps
