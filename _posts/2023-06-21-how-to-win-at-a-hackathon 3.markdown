I attended the A.team's Generative AI Hackathon last weekend. I hadn't attended one in a few years and it reminded me why I love them. They're a lot of work, but the look of accomplishment on every teams face at the end is well worth the lack of sleep.
No, you won't find my winning deck or some kind of crazy framework in this article. This is about winning by just going to a hacakthon.

Here are 3 reasons why I love hackathons:

# #1 You'll make new connections
The last hackathon I attend, A.Teams's Generative AI, I met some amazing people. Hackathons are about connecting.

At the beginning of the hackathon we did a few breakout sessions to meet people on other teams. I had never been to a hackathon thta did this and it was a great idea and every hackathon should do it. As you work on your individual projects there is no time to talk to other teams. As these teams are your compition, there is some natural animosity. By introducing us in the beginning, I saw the other teams, not as competitors, but as friends. I learned about what drives them and found some common ground.

This round robin is how I met Henry Duang, a medical professional turned developer. Henry joined the hackathon...[insert Henry's story here]

## Facilitate connections
It occurred to me that i knew another medical professional turned tech, Bryan Gersham, MD. I had been mentoring Bryan on how to get his idea funded using the SBIR.gov program. How do I know Bryan? He reached out after watching one of my LinkIn Learning videos. Not enough people do this. You never know who will respond. Some people won't. Some people will. In 2016 I reached out to Andy Hunt to ask questions about Agile and his alternative GROWS. He responded. I met with Andy about my board game
The point is, connect with people you work with. You never know what will come of it in a few years.

## Reach out
Speaking of reaching out, During the hackathon I reached out to motor.com, based on a recomendation from my menotr, Rusty Patel. Motor.com had the type of data we needed to integrate into our product. As the Product Manager and team lead, I jumped right in and sent an inquery to motor.com and as it turns out, they had a API Sandbox ready to go! Their brilliant sales rep, Jennie Davis helped my team quickly get access to this information. 

I talked with Jennie yesterday, and as we are moving forward with the project, I am discussing a contract with her. She might have made a sale and I got my data. win-win.

## Find a co-founder
During the final presentations, I saw a demo that just blew me away. Armagan Amcalar built a story telling app for kids in hospital. I knew immediately that I had to connect with him. I had another project, Alika's Treehouse (for which I won a hackathon with in 2016) that was similar, as well as a current project where I was trying to do something similar with Generative AI. I had been trying to find someone who could help me write my second SBIR grant that had the background in Generative AI, and Armagan was it!

# #2 You'll do something new
## A chance to lead

# #3 You'll have something for your portfolio
Use you hakathon work to build a portfolio! Should I have a portfolio as a dev? Yes! should I include it if it's a prototype? Yes! Just make sure you give approprite credit to who did wht.
write article like I did

# Conclusion
So what am i doing now that the hackathon is over. Well fisrt I slept, but then it was time to get to work. Preparing an article, creating videos I could use socially and with ivestors and users, getting on the phone to get additional feedback, applying to incubators and pitch competitions.
