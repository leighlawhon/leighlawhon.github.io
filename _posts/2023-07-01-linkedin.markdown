# Background
Since 2017, I have had the opportunity to build an tutorials for LinkedIn Learning. My projects aim to teach  concepts of JavaScript to beginner and intermediate developers, using narrative and project-based learning. 

For each project, I developed (2-3 months) and the recorded the course (1 week).

## Approach
In all my courses, I strive to create a narrative that complements the learning objectives. By leveraging analogies, I am able to elucidate complex JavaScript concepts in a simplified and easily understandable format for learners.

## Results
