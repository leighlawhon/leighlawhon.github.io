## Background
I have always believed in Project-Based learning. Since my first coding endeavour with Python/Django I learned quickly that not all tutorials are up to date or explain every aspect well. I also am a believer and build my courses around "project-based learning," and prefer to build a project as I learn so that I can translate the concepts I learn into tangible products.

Jump into a course, every one starts from a different starting point

## Approach
Teaching is one of the most complex activities I've ever had the pleasure of taking part in. It has many variable. For exmple, you may be teaching someone (Persona) about a something (Subject) and you can teach it in various ways (Themes) that relate to your personas or context. 

To account for these variables, my approach is to break traditional curriculumn into components that can be mixed and matched dynamiclaly, allowing teacher to personalize lessons. 

To understand the dynamic way content can be mixed and matched, use the tool below to execute the following steps. Use the Reset button after each step to reset the tool.

### Content Reuse
#### Steps
1. Switch between Personas. Here we are using a Beginner and an Advanced Persona, but this could be a child, adult, or working professional with industry knowledge

#### Note
Notice how some content can be resused across personas and how related learning can be customized.

### Personalization
#### Steps
1. Select 1 Persona and 1 Subject
2. Switch between Themes

#### Note
Notice how each subject can ber taught with multiple themes, customized to an Activity, Teaching Style or Personal Interest.

### Cross-Discipline Learning
#### Steps
1. Select 1 Persona and 1 Theme
2. Switch between Subjects

#### Note
Notice how each subject can be taught with multiple themes, customized to an Activity, Teaching Style or Personal Interest.

### Organic Learning
#### Steps
1. Select 1 Persona and 1 Subject

#### Note
Notice how each lesson can lead to other topics, either for deeper understanding, or addional interests
