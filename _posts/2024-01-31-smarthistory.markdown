## Background
As an Product Manager, I regularly search the internet to support my projects, researching many topics across many types of sties. An example project is the research I did for my 2024 SBIR grant, which included searches on ADHD, Autism, Machine Learning, Generative AI, and SBIR requirements. I found that it was hard to track this work, even with well organized bookmarks using Google Chrome.

Being in the tech industry for more than 20 years, my Chrome bookmarks are out of date. Additionally, the top down organization makes referencing material that may support another project difficult to find, relying only on my memory as to where I bookmarked the information.

Additionally, when working on [Synapse]({{base_url}}/work/2023/07/01/synapse.html), there was a feature frequest for a history tracker, allowing researchers to see the progression of their research. I saw a similar need for my own work, as I am interested in researching how I learn a topic. You can learn more about my approach to organic learning in my article [Project-Based, Organic Learning]({{base_url}}/article/2024/01/31/project_based_organic_learning.html)

### Problem Statement
Searching the internet for work, hobies, projects and interests is a dialy occurance. Site History contains a wealth of knowledge, but is unstructures. Manual bookmarks, the current solution, quickly become outdated and unmanageable.

### Vision
Unlike other products in the market, SmartHistory focuses on the path knowledge workers take on project. It automatically tags page content and the type of site. Tagged content can then be cross referenced across multiple projects, creating an up-to-date, flexible bookmarking system that meets the needs of modern internet users.
