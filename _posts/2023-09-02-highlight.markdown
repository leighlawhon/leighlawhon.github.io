## Background
The project's aim was to create a summary tool that would extract and highlight text relevant to a specific search term using Natural Language Processing. The application was developed using Angular and D3JS, enabling researchers to swiftly locate pertinent passages in context.

## Approach
I devised an interface that swiftly and clearly conveyed crucial information, while also allowing the easy reveal of additional details through a slider. On the right sidebar, abstracted entity data such as locations, organizations, and people were presented alongside relevance scores.

## Results
The tool performed admirably in user testing, although it was noted that incorporating research tracking enhancements was a crucial element for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## Next Steps
This feature was deployed into production and subsequently received additional functionalities to aid research tasks, including features like bookmarking and note-taking.
