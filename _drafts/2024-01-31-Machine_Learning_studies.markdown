## Background
I have been facinated with Machine Learning (ML) since I was the product manager and designer for a company with an Natural Language Processing (NLP) platform. In 2017, I took a Data Analystics course at General Assembly. It was a great introductory course, though admittedly, some of it was over my head. Just as how designing UI led me to teach myself to code, my work with an NLP product led me to explore ML. In early 2024, I restarted the endeavor and began a [Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing) and started work on a project, [Job Description Classification for Product Management Roles]({{base_url}}/article/2024/01/31/job_description_classification_PM.html), that analyzed job descriptions for Product Managers (PM), as the role is multifaceted. 

## Approach
You can read about my approach to learning and teaching in my Article: [Project-Based, Organic Education]({{base_url}}/articles/2024-01-31-project_based_organic_learning.markdown).

For the NLP Specialization, I suplemented my education with the following videos from [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning):
- [Applied Machine Learning: Feature Engineering](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/applied-machine-learning-feature-engineering/) 
  - The first course, [Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces](https://www.coursera.org/learn/classification-vector-spaces-in-nlp?specialization=natural-language-processing) quickly discuss feature extraction and pulls out the Top 10 most common words. I wanted to go deeper into this subject and explore, clean, and prepare my data. My goal for my [Job Description Classification for Product Management Roles]({{base_url}}/article/2024/01/31/job_description_classification_PM.html) project was, not just to find the top words in a PM job description, but to categroie them into specific PM roles.
  - One thing [Derek Jedamski](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/derek-jedamski) points out is the imprtance of "common sense and domain expertise" in feature engineering. I come from a human-center-design background and this seems to be a neglected topic. Many courses cover code and algorithims, and not the human on the other end of the keyboard.
