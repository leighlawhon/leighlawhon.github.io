<!-- 
When prioritizing there will be conflict, where two or more stakeholders or features compete for the same spot. So what do you do then? In my experience, I first lean of leadership for guidance. However, when you are in a start up environmentn, company goals may be unclear, for example all stakeholders are fighting for your time to execute on their solutions to complete comapny OKRs. When this happens, I use the follwoing approaches and ask for buy in from the stake holders.

- **Linear:** Have the competing stakeholders rank and then complete features end-to-end and then move on to the next.
    - Benefit: Keeps the development team focused.
    - Drawback: Some teams have to wait a long time to get their work done, and teams that are not client facing, like the developer team, keep getting pushed back.
- **Ratios:** Split your teams into smaller pods, working on multiple team features. You can do a 50/50 split or a 30/70 split depending whether you want to put more emphasis on one feature.
    - Benefit: Engages more stakeholders
    - Drawback: The work get's done slower
- **Pivots:** Split the year and work on OKR's sequetially, pivoting to the next after MVP is complete.
    - Benefit: This can work well with early startups, 
    - Drawback: Sacrificing quarterly progress on one OKR. You must make sure you can address multiple OKRs in a year. -->
