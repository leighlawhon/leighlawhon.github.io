## Background
### document uploads for Webforce
The work I do for CapitalOne is very process oriented and is 90% project management. We take manual processes and put them into SalesForce. As a PM I was asked to put some numbers around the work we did. Product Leadership's KPI focus was on adoption/usage and reducing the time to complete a task. Business Leadership's OKR focus was on moving and maintain their work in Salesforce and get reporting on the work they did.

Product OKRs
â€¢ Build a Digital first experience
  - infrastructure


I had 2 strategies:
1. Split the work into "Business Driven" and "Product Driven"
2. Use a ratio of work to balance the requests from stakeholders

Metrics with meaning:
1. Business Driven: this work had 100% adoption rate, because of course, the goal for the bank was to reduce risk by getting associates out of excel and email. There was no choice for associates to adopt or not. Sometimes this work increased the time to completion (example: using emails vs approval through SF). The better metric here would have been NPS, but we were not allowed to do NPS.
